SQL Testing Scripts for Educational Purposes

Overview
This directory contains SQL scripts designed specifically to demonstrate a variety of database operations within the context of a pet_grooming database.
These scripts are crafted to test database functionalities ranging from simple data insertion to complex joins, views, and triggers.

Objectives
The testing scripts in this directory aim to:

Demonstrate Database Operations: Each script illustrates a specific SQL command or set of commands, showcasing how to interact with and manipulate a 
relational database effectively.
Educational Tool: These scripts are excellent resources for students and learners to understand and apply SQL concepts in a practical setting.
Functional Testing: Serve as examples for how to test different database functionalities, including connectivity, data integrity, automated timestamping with triggers,
and more.

Script Descriptions
Here is a brief overview of what each script is designed to test:

Database Table Overview: Shows all tables within the database to provide a quick schema reference.
Table Structure Exploration: Details the structure of specific tables, demonstrating the use of SHOW CREATE TABLE.
Database Connectivity Tests: Ensures that users can successfully connect to the database using different user profiles.
Data Manipulation: Inserts data into tables, updates it, and then fetches it to illustrate basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
View Implementation and Querying: Creates and queries views to simplify complex SQL queries and improve database readability and maintenance.
Trigger Functionality: Tests triggers for automated actions during database operations.
Join Operations: Uses JOIN clauses to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
Stored Procedure Execution: Calls a stored procedure to calculate and retrieve data based on specific input criteria, showing encapsulation of business logic.
User Management and Security: Demonstrates the creation of database users with specific privileges, focusing on security and access control.

Usage
To use these scripts:

Setup: Ensure your MySQL environment is set up and that you have appropriate permissions to create databases, tables, and execute other SQL commands.
Execution: Run the scripts in a sequential order to see how each operation affects the database and the data stored within.
